## Overview

Welcome to **Photophobia**, a chilling venture into the dark where light is your most precious resource and often your only perceived ally. Developed as an student project at Full Sail University by Team Spector(Tyson, Jason, Roxanne, Jordan), this game plunges you into a desperate situation; where you struggle for survival within a nightmarish world. You are not a heavily armed soldier, but an ordinary individual who must rely on wits, developing strategies, and the scarce tools you can scavenge to navigate and overcome the terrifying entities being brought to life.

The world of Photophobia is a grim, dark and oppressive environment. Prepare to explore a sprawling, interconnected facility, from desolate, fog-filled industrial halls to other specialized zones, each designed to test your resolve. Every corner turned could lead to a deadly encounter with a variety of horrifying creatures, whose behaviors and interactions are being actively developed to ensure a challenging experience.
